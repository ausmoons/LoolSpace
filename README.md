## Inspiration

Currently, in the education process, students are required to memorize many concepts and facts, but not always it is easy. When we read we remember only around 20 %, but when we see things we remember around 80%. We want to **increase the number of items in students' memory using augmented reality**. 

## What it does

Our concept integrates XR markers into student textbooks and allows them to use AR glasses for seeing objects and placing them in a memory palace [_method of loci_](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Method_of_Loci/). Each item represents a concept which student needs to remember. They can save multiple memory palaces to their phones or computers. When a student needs to prepare for a test, he can go through multiple memory palaces, see what he remembers and know what he needs to revise. This could be very beneficial in social science and STEM when you need to remember for example all parts of a brain, a heart, or a subatomic structure. This method will help them to remember more concepts than just trying to remember each concept separately or by creating a memory palace in their mind.

## How we built it

We built it on _Unity v2019.3.0_ using the _Unity XR Management package v3.0.6_.

## Challenges we ran into

 - Grasp new technologies in a very short time period.
 - Little time to prepare an example from a book, using AR glasses till seeing the result on the phone or computer with multiple memory palaces.
 - Small team size and few mentors.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We could prepare a small demo item using unity and AR glasses. We could **validate** that seeing things through AR is more exciting and it is easier to recall those items from the memory compared to a situation when we would need to image the palace and all items inside.

## What we learned

 - How AR could be used and how it could be helpful in the study process.
 - How to create simple things using Unity.

## What's next for Lool Space

 - Look for possibilities of how AR can help us improve our lives and education system.
